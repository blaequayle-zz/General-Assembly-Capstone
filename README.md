### General Assembly Capstone Project: Sharing is Caring

This repository contains the documentation and code for my Capstone project undertaken as part of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course between October 2017 and January 2018 with feedback provided by Aymeric Flaisler.

1. **Part 1: Pitch and Problem Statement** - Define the problem statement, potential audience, goals, success metrics and data sources. Host a [lightning talk presentation](Part_1/Capstone Project Ideas.pdf) describing two of these proposals.

2. **Part 2: Dataset and Data Collection** - Source and format the required data for your project, perform preliminary data munging and cleaning of your data. Describe your data keeping your intended audience in mind. Document your work so far in a [Jupyter notebook](Part_2/Capstone_Part2_Acquire_Clean 2.ipynb).

3. **Part 3: EDA and Preliminary Analysis** - Quantitatively describe and visualise your data, maintain perspective on your goals and scope accordingly. Create a [progress report](Part_3/Capstone_Part3_EDA.ipynb) with approach to EDA, initial results and any surprises encountered. Discuss proposed next steps.

4. **Part 4: Modelling** - Detail your model and approach with concisely commented code, beginning with executive summary. Evaluate model performance and discuss results. Submit a [complete notebook](Part_4/Capstone_Part4_Modelling.ipynb) of the model.

5. **Part 5: Presentation** - Host a short, well rehearsed [presentation](Part_5/Sharing is Caring - Predicting Daily Cycle Hires.pdf) of your project for a non-technical audience. Cover goals, success criteria, data, approach, basic description of model, findings, risks/limitations, impact, next steps and conclusions.
